# Necromatic

This is the repository for an Open-Source game built in Unity. The intends to be topdown RTS/RPG-style, inspired by Dwarf Fortress, Factorio and Diablo II. It will have a gameplay style sort of similar to Factorio but borrow 'micro-management' from Dwarf Fortress, and draw atmospheric style from Diablo II.  

## Gameplay
You will play as a necromancer whose ultimate goal is to conquer the realm (and beyond?).
In the beginning you will be killing your first victims manually. As time moves on and your powers grow, you will begin to delegate some of your tasks to lower ranked necromancers in your horde, allowing you to abstract to a higher military level of command. You'll start with small lonely houses, step up to villages, towns, castles and eventually kingdoms. But beware, your conquered unholy grounds will be tested by lone adventurers, parties of heroes or even noble armies.

Anyway that's the plan, let's see how far I get before this dies or Unity kills me first.
Also I'm going to try doing this in 3D because I will have an easier time implementing that than sprite-stuff and I want to be better at Blender.

## Plan

I'll be updating the game with the goal of building a MVP version ASAP.

### Iteration 1 - DONE

Moveable Necromancer. Killable humans.

### Iteration 2

Humans attack. Pathfinding implemented.

### Iteration 3

Humans can be raised as skeletons, skeletons attack humans.

### Iteration 4

???
